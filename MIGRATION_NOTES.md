# LAN Scanner Migration Notes

## What was done:
1. Created native Swift implementation for network scanning:
   - `NativeNetworkScanner.swift` - Main scanner class using native iOS APIs
   - `NativeWiFiDevice.swift` - Device model for discovered devices
   
2. Updated existing files to use native implementation:
   - `NetworkScanner.swift` - Now wraps the native scanner
   - `WiFiDevice.swift` - Updated to support both old and new device models
   - `LanDeviceDetailView.swift` - Updated to use direct properties instead of `.data`
   - `ScanResultDetailView.swift` - Updated to use direct properties

## Features of the native implementation:
- Bonjour/mDNS service discovery for legitimate devices
- IP range scanning with connectivity checks
- Device type detection based on services
- Security assessment based on vendor and service types
- Progress tracking during scan

## To complete the migration:

### Remove LanScanner package dependency in Xcode:
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the project in the navigator
3. Go to "Package Dependencies" tab
4. Find "lan-scanner" and click the minus (-) button to remove it
5. Clean and rebuild the project

### Alternative manual removal (if needed):
The package references are in `hidden camera.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:
- Line 13: Build file reference
- Line 38: Framework reference  
- Line 108: Package product dependency
- Lines 423-430: Package reference definition
- Lines 444-447: Product reference

## Testing:
After removing the package dependency, test the scanning functionality:
1. WiFi device scanning should discover devices on the local network
2. Device details should show IP, hostname, and security status
3. Progress indicator should work during scanning

## Known limitations of native implementation:
- MAC address retrieval requires additional permissions or ARP table access
- Vendor identification is simplified (would benefit from a MAC vendor database)
- Some device names might show as "Unknown" if hostname resolution fails

## Future improvements:
- Add MAC address retrieval using system APIs
- Implement vendor database for better device identification
- Add more sophisticated security checks
- Optimize scanning performance with concurrent operations
